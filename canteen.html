<p>In the canteen, you can help yourself to hot food, soup, salad,
  cold cuts and bread from our buffet, and pay by weight.
  In addition, you will find a wide selection of wraps and buttered products,
  tempting cakes and baked goods and good coffee drinks.
  Everything served in large, bright and modern premises.</p>

<h3>Eat & Meet at Kjeller</h3>

<p>Hanna's dining room at Kjeller sets a long table every Thursday, and invites you to a social and affordable meal! Pay NOK 75,
  sit down and eat as much as you want. At the same time,
  you can use the chance to have a chat with someone you know, or get to know some new people.</p>
