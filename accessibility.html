<p style="font-size:23px;">When making this website, accessibility was a huge factor.
  Accessibility is about making the website functional, accessible, and user-friendly.
  This website is easily accessible and easy to use and understand.</p>

<p style="font-size:23px;"> The codes in the program were tested using automated testing.
  I used the tool "W3C validator" to test the program. The following screenshot show the result from the test:</p>
<p style="font-size:23px;"> When the test was completed, there ware no erros or warnings to show:</p>

<p style="font-size:23px;"> Uneversial desegn focuses on creating digital experiences that are usable by people of all abilities and disabilities.
This webpage has the same colors in every page, a big and easy usable menu with a font color and size that makes it easy for the user to see and understand how the manu works.
The webpage also have big photos with good quality so that it is also user-friendly for people with poor eyesight.
  This website is also suitable for people with reading difficulties as the language used is not too advanced.
The images have alternative text. This allows users with visual impairments to understand the content conveyed by the images.</p>
